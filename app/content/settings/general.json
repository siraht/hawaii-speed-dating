  "welcomeText": "# Aloha Hawaii speed daters!!\n\nWelcome to an exciting fun way to meet new people! Recently created by two inspired and creative Maui residents to expand our desires to meet new people. Hawaii speed dating events are held outdoors in Kihei, Lahaina and Kahului at local oceanside beach parks from 3:30-5:30 Sundays. Arrive at 3:15. Event begins at 3:30 please do not be late, tardiness impacts the entire group flow. Let’s all make good first impressions. Group size is limited to 10 men and 10 women, first come first serve.\n\nWe will open with a group connection game that will engage the senses and get the energy moving.  Remember this is SPEED dating so we want to wake up to get started. You will experience one on one 8 minute dates with up to 10 new individuals. The facilitators will prompt each speed dating round with enlivening and thought provoking question. A system is in place for you track who is a yes and a no. Once you have “dated” everyone you will privately share your desires with the facilitators who will share contact information if and only if you choose each other.\n\n### Requests:\n- Arrive sober\n- Stay through the entire event\n- Join with an open mind and heart\n- Bring a blanket or low chair to sit on and water bottle\n- Stay for sunset, maybe bring pupu’s\n\n\n ## Your facilitators are Maui residents Bonnie Slater and Jenn Wakefield\n\nJenn Wakefield has been on Maui for 28 years.  She has experience in emotional connection workshops and team building skills as a participant as well as facilitator.  Her passions lay within deep connections of the human heart and learning to grow together.  She is most often found out hiking deep into the mountains or diving below the surface of ocean blue.  She is known as kind, generous and playful.\n\nBonnie Slater grew up in Boulder Colorado where she studied relational leadership and authentic relating skills.  Her career as a birth doula gives her the capacity to hold an open minded space. She has been living on Maui part time for 17 years and permanently moved to Maui (again) in early 2020. Her ideal day includes time in the ocean and connecting with friends and family by adventuring or sharing a meal. She finds purpose, joy and laughter everywhere she goes.\n\n\n ## Registration\nSecure your spot by paying $40 via Venmo to [@Hawaiispeeddating](https://account.venmo.com/u/hawaiispeeddating)\nGot questions?
